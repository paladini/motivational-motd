# Motivational-motd
A new motivational Message of The Day (MoTD) every day.

If you're reading the readme from this stupid project, then you're an asshole that probably haven't anyone to watch Netflix and chill. If you recognize yourself in the description above you're in the right place and should keep reading, otherwise go home and live your fucking perfect life.

If you're a dumbass nerd like me, I think you need a brand new motivational [motd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motd_%28Unix%29) (Message of the Day) every day because it probably will get worse. You know, those who doubt your ability probably have a valid reason.

## Requirements
Make sure that you've all the following prerequisites in order to install and use this software:

:white_check_mark: Use Linux<br/>
:white_check_mark: Use systemd<br/>
:white_check_mark: Be an asshole<br/>
:white_check_mark: Don't have a boyfriend || girlfriend.

## How it works
In summary, this project will install a kind of recurrent task (actually, a [systemd timer](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/Timers)) that will run every day at 00:00 changing the current phrase to a brand new and motivational phrase. There's just one better thing to your life than reading a different motivational phrase every morning: having a life (that's not your case).

## How to install
If you need instructions in order to install this motivational software, your case is worst than I ever imagined. Anyway, life is stupid and hard - just like you, so let's help you:

**Install:**
[download the project](https://github.com/paladini/motivational-motd/archive/master.zip) and extract it anywhere. After that, go to the extracted folder using your Terminal and enter the following commands:
```
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh  # you'll be asked for administrative permissions
```

**Uninstall:**
```
$ chmod +x uninstall.sh
$ ./uninstall.sh
```

## Contributions
As you probably have noticed, I'm a looser that can't write nice motivational phrases, so please help me inserting more motivational phrases and quotes. 

If you're a truly looser, you'll like this project and make some contributions to it. There's several ways you can help fucking other people lives, like:
- Add more motivational phrases or quotes (make a PR or [just open an issue](https://github.com/paladini/motivational-motd/issues))
- Work in a new readme for this project (with a decent English) 
- Add support to other init systems
- Suggest new features
- Scold me
- Anything you can imagine (I think you know what's imagination, because imagination is the only way you have to escape from the miserable reality of your life).
